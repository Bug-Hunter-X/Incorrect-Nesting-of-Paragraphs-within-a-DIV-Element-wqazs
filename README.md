# Incorrect Nesting of Paragraphs in HTML

This repository demonstrates a subtle HTML bug related to the nesting of paragraph elements (`<p>`) within a division element (`<div>`).

The bug manifests as inconsistencies in rendering across different browsers. Some browsers might render the nested paragraphs correctly, while others might produce unexpected layout results.

**Bug Description:**
Nested paragraph elements within a `div` element might render with unexpected spacing or formatting depending on the browser's rendering engine. The issue occurs because browsers have different interpretations for how they should handle the semantics of such a structure.

**How to reproduce:**
1. Open `bug.html` in various browsers.
2. Observe the rendering differences in the layout of the nested paragraphs.

**Solution:**
The solution provided in `solution.html` emphasizes consistent and semantically correct HTML structure.  Avoid nesting paragraphs directly within a `div` unless you have a specific stylistic reason to do so, and that reason is universally compatible with browser rendering engines.

This example highlights the importance of validating and testing HTML code across multiple browsers to ensure a consistent user experience.  The correct approach is to structure content semantically, opting for more appropriate elements when necessary instead of relying on nested `p` elements.
